# Current Context: Cadance for Publishers

## Current State
The project has been successfully transformed from a complex tab-based interface to a clean, mobile-first single-page marketing site. The site is now production-ready and configured for GitHub Pages deployment at cadance.music.

## Recent Changes
- **Complete UI refactor**: Removed tab system, implemented single-page flow
- **Mobile-first responsive design**: Breakpoints at 600px and 1024px
- **Real asset integration**: Replaced all placeholder content with actual Cadance brand materials
- **Accessibility implementation**: Skip links, semantic HTML, WCAG AA compliance
- **GitHub Pages setup**: CNAME, .nojekyll, and deployment configuration complete
- **SEO optimization**: Complete meta tags, Open Graph, Twitter Cards
- **Performance optimization**: Lazy loading, proper image sizing, no external dependencies

## Current Focus
Memory bank initialization and documentation of the completed project architecture and decisions.

## Technical Status
- **HTML**: Clean semantic structure with proper landmarks
- **CSS**: Mobile-first with design tokens and fluid typography
- **JavaScript**: Legacy code present but not used by current implementation
- **Assets**: All real Cadance brand materials properly integrated
- **Deployment**: Ready for GitHub Pages with custom domain

## Next Steps
1. Clean up unused JavaScript code from legacy tab system
2. Final testing and validation
3. DNS configuration for cadance.music domain
4. Launch preparation

## Issues Identified
- **JavaScript cleanup needed**: script.js contains legacy tab functionality not used in current single-page design
- **Performance opportunity**: Remove unused JavaScript to reduce bundle size
