- **All section headers**: Transformed from negative to positive messaging

## Strategic Impact
The transformation successfully repositions Cadance from asking for favors (artwork permissions) to offering valuable partnership opportunities (audience conversion support). This creates a much stronger value proposition for both dance teachers and musicians, positioning Cadance as an essential partner in the music ecosystem rather than just another app.

The tone transformation eliminates potential friction with artists who use multiple distribution channels while maintaining the core business logic that music ownership enables professional capabilities. This creates broader market appeal and stronger collaborative relationships.
