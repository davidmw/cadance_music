# Current Context: Cadance Marketing Site

## Current State
The site is a static, multi‑page marketing site hosted on GitHub Pages:
- Teacher‑focused homepage at [index.html](index.html)
- Musicians & Album Sellers page at [publishers/index.html](publishers/index.html) - **MAJOR TRANSFORMATION**
- Artist Partnership page at [partnership.html](partnership.html) - **NEW**
- Tempo Notes at [tempo-notes.html](tempo-notes.html)
- Privacy policy at [privacy.html](privacy.html)
- FAQ at [faq.html](faq.html)
- Safety redirect at [publishers.html](publishers.html) → /publishers/

Design system split across [styles.base.css](styles.base.css), [styles.layout.css](styles.layout.css), [styles.components.css](styles.components.css), and [styles.parallax.css](styles.parallax.css). Progressive enhancement JavaScript runs via [script.js](script.js) for parallax and selectable personas; pages remain fully usable without JS.
