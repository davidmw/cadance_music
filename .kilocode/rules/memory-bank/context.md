## Current Implementation Notes
- **Pricing cards** are consistent across the pricing page and BarreNotes landing page (Spark / Artist).
  - Artist is the top and hero tier ("Most Popular") and includes Apple Music, Focus Player, and Syllabus; cards size to content (no forced equal heights).
  - Styling lives in [`styles.components.css`](styles.components.css:1736) and markup in [`pricing/index.html`](pricing/index.html:93), [`reddit/index.html`](reddit/index.html:242), [`barrenotes/index.html`](barrenotes/index.html:259).
- **v3 shipped**: removed the “Coming with v3” release badge from the site (pricing + landing pages) and removed `.tier-pill--v3` styling.
- **Landing-page App Store CTA**: landing CTA uses the same base button styling as home via `.btn.btn-primary`, with landing-specific sizing/centering.
  - CTA copy: “Download Free - Start Teaching Better”
  - Markup: [`reddit/index.html`](reddit/index.html:79), [`barrenotes/index.html`](barrenotes/index.html:79)
  - Styling/sizing: landing-specific centering + width lives in [`styles.components.css`](styles.components.css:1044)

- **Landing-page hero copy**: Reddit landing hero headline updated.
  - Markup: [`reddit/index.html`](reddit/index.html:76)

- **Landing-page CTA microcopy cleanup**: removed the two “benefits-note” lines directly below the top CTA on both landing pages.
  - Markup: [`reddit/index.html`](reddit/index.html:76), [`barrenotes/index.html`](barrenotes/index.html:76)

- **Tempo demo video**: swapped `Tempo_demo.mp4` → `BalletTempoDemoV1CroppedComposite.mp4` and updated the How To “Changing tempo” poster to match the new video.
  - Markup: [`reddit/index.html`](reddit/index.html:85), [`how-to.html`](how-to.html:106)
  - New asset: [`videos/BalletTempoDemoV1CroppedComposite_poster.jpg`](videos/BalletTempoDemoV1CroppedComposite_poster.jpg:1)

- **Pricing copy + emphasis tweaks**:
  - Artist is the most-popular, top subscription tier across pricing and landing-page cards.
  - Artist includes Apple Music, Focus Player, and Syllabus; the site no longer distinguishes downloaded Apple Music playback.
  - Increased Artist tier title + price typography (scoped to `.pricing-tier--popular`).
  - Markup: [`pricing/index.html`](pricing/index.html:119), [`reddit/index.html`](reddit/index.html:260), [`barrenotes/index.html`](barrenotes/index.html:276)
  - Styling: [`styles.components.css`](styles.components.css:1923)
- **Pricing hero**: removed the Pricing page hero image; Pricing now uses a text-only hero section.
  - **Testimonials**: cards are tappable (CSS-only modal via `:target`) and include an always-visible “Click/Tap to read more” affordance.
  - Styles: [`styles.components.css`](styles.components.css:190)
- **JavaScript is not a placeholder**: [`script.js`](script.js:1) provides progressive enhancement (parallax + mobile menu toggle). Microsoft Clarity is installed site-wide.

- **Private screenshots gallery**: [`barrenotes/BarreNotesPosts/index.html`](barrenotes/BarreNotesPosts/index.html:1)
  - `noindex,nofollow` meta.
  - Cards are sorted by `data-post-date` newest→oldest and laid out in two columns (fill left column first, then right).
  - Crawlers discouraged via `Disallow: /barrenotes/BarreNotesPosts/` in [`robots.txt`](robots.txt:1).

## Cadance v6 Marketing Refresh (July 2026)

- Homepage, Features, Pricing, FAQ, Partners, Blog, and sitemap have been updated for Cadance v6.
- The v6 message leads with free Teacher Notebook, linked music, Focus Player, Day Passes, Perfect Practice Passes, and Artist Syllabus.
- Pricing now omits monetary amounts and directs users to App Store-localized pricing. It explicitly retains the 14 free Day Passes and 1 free Perfect Practice Pass for new users.
- Added four posts: v6 release, Teacher Notebook workflow, Perfect Practice Passes, and Ran Bagno featured artist.
- Added approved Ran Bagno portrait from Vertigo locally as `ran-bagno-portrait.jpg` and added the artist to `partners.html`.
- Removed remaining live links to the deleted Patron Directory, updated public footers to 2026, and removed the old Patron Directory sitemap entry.
- Product screenshot files were supplied in the repository and converted to optimized WebP derivatives (500 KB total). `index.html` uses the handwritten Ran Bagno deep-link and Focus Player workflow; `features.html` uses the typed Notebook and both iPhone Notebook captures; the Artist Syllabus section uses the Syllabus capture.
- Feature/access messaging now distinguishes free Class Planning Mode from Spark as the BarreNotes-equivalent playback tier. Features use "Countdown to start" wording, document Focus Player repeat options, describe Syllabus as a music source, and no longer mention the removed volume-warning feature.
- FAQ now explains why Spotify and other streaming services cannot support Cadance's playback model, and clarifies that Apple Music/Cadance subscriptions are playback tools rather than studio-performance licences; any such rights are a publisher or rights-holder issue.
- The 15-second Day Pass gate only applies when a track is outside the user's current entitlement, including DRM-protected tracks attempted with Spark. If the user cancels the banner, Cadance does not prompt again in that session; those uncovered tracks stop at the preview limit until the user manually activates a pass through Settings > Day Passes > Activate a Day Pass Now.
- Blog chronology records Perfect Practice Passes as a Cadance v5 feature on June 2, 2026, and the Ran Bagno featured artist post as July 11, 2026.

## Next Steps
- Capture/finalize App Store preview videos and release-date wording before publishing the external announcement.
- The app can link users to `/forms/request-art/` for the Rinat Zaripov dance-art note request. The route is now backed by a live Cloudflare Worker (`worker/`, `cadance-art-request`) that captures requests to KV and emails two `.cadnote` files. See "Request-art fulfilment (Aug 2026)" below for status and remaining setup.

## Request-art fulfilment (Aug 2026)

- **Purpose**: capture name/email/(optional)phone from `/forms/request-art/` and deliver the Rinat Zaripov `.cadnote` art notes.
- **Delivery split** (decided by owner): the two SMALLER notes go by EMAIL now; the two LARGER are reserved for a future SMS channel.
  - Email attachments: `Jazz Dancer With Links.cadnote` (327 KB), `Prodigal Son With Links.cadnote` (1.20 MB) → ~2.0 MB base64, under the Cloudflare Email 5 MiB cap.
  - Reserved for SMS (as links): `Ballet 5th With Links.cadnote` (1.28 MB), `Ballet pair With Links.cadnote` (1.25 MB).
  - All four committed to `forms/request-art/notes/` (public GitHub Pages).
- **Backend**: `worker/` dir in THIS repo → Worker `cadance-art-request` at `https://cadance-art-request.davidaus.workers.dev`. `POST /request-art`: honeypot → validate → Turnstile verify → store KV (`ART_REQUESTS`, 90-day TTL) → email via `[[send_email]]` binding. Mirrors cadance-init conventions. Source of truth for setup is `worker/README.md`.
- **Phone**: kept OPTIONAL on the form, with an unticked SMS-consent checkbox; stored for the future SMS send.
- **Privacy**: `privacy.html` now documents form-data collection, Cloudflare processing, and retention.
- **Remaining manual setup (owner, in dashboards)**:
  1. Cloudflare Turnstile: create widget → put site key in `forms/request-art/index.html` (`data-sitekey`) → `wrangler secret put TURNSTILE_SECRET` in `worker/`. ✅ DONE
  2. Cloudflare Email Service: sender domain `cadance.music` onboarded via `npx wrangler email sending enable cadance.music` (dashboard "Onboard Domain" dropdown was empty right after zone activation). ✅ DONE — verified a live send (`emailStatus: sent`, message id `...@cadance.music`).
  3. Sender is `Cadance <notes@cadance.music>` (set in `worker/wrangler.toml` `[vars]`).
- **Status: LIVE and verified end-to-end (30 Aug 2026).** A real form submission stored to KV and emailed the two notes successfully.
- **Ops lessons learned**:
  - Reading captured requests: `wrangler kv key list/get` are LOCAL by default — always pass `--remote`, else they show `[]`/“Value not found” even when the Worker wrote data. (Confirmed via workers-sdk issue #10395.)
  - Email records live on the `cf-bounce.cadance.music` subdomain (MX/SPF/DKIM) + `_dmarc`. Note: onboarding set `_dmarc` to `p=reject` (was `p=none`) — monitor that this doesn't affect the existing Hover mailbox / MailerLite sending.
  - `E_SENDER_DOMAIN_NOT_CONFIGURED` = domain not onboarded to Email Service (distinct from DNS existing).
