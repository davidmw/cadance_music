# Product: Cadance Marketing Site

## Why This Project Exists
Cadance is a dance class music app built to keep classes moving with fast access, class‑friendly controls, and reliable playback. The marketing site now serves three audiences:
1) Dance teachers — the primary audience and homepage focus
2) Organizations — studios, companies, programs via a White Label option
3) Rights holders — clear, transparent permissions for using album artwork in App Store/Play and Cadance promotional materials

## Problems It Solves
1. For Teachers
   - Speed and focus: less device fiddling, more time on students
   - Reliability: predictable playback that matches class flow
   - Organization: simple structure for sets/classes
2. For Organizations (White Label)
   - Consistent brand experience across static marketing surfaces
   - Streamlined onboarding and coordination for large teaching teams
   - Single contact path and clear timelines
3. For Rights Holders (Publishers)
   - Legal compliance with transparent usage scope
   - Proper credit and revocable permissions
   - Professional, repeatable process with stored records

## How It Should Work
The site operates as a multi‑page marketing funnel:

1) Home (Teacher‑focused)
   - Hero: clear benefit (keep the class moving)
   - Features: speed, class control, reliability, organization, focus, heritage
   - Personas: freelancers, studio staff, company instructors, competition teams, online instructors
   - Screenshots: in‑context visuals with correct dimensions, lazy loading, async decoding
   - White Label teaser: highlight organizational option
   - CTAs: Join waitlist (mailto), plus links to White Label and Publishers

2) White Label (Organizations)
   - Who it’s for: large studios, companies, programs, universities, outreach
   - Value pillars: brand consistency, simple rollout, priority coordination, built for teaching
   - Process: email → scope proposal → confirm & coordinate
   - CTA: enterprise mailto

3) Publishers (Rights Holders)
   - Why partner: exposure to dance educators; controlled usage
   - Transparency: scope, regions, revocation, no resale, no third‑party licensing
   - Process: step‑by‑step email approval workflow
   - Showcase: in‑context images
   - CTA: partnerships mailto

## User Experience Goals
- Immediate clarity (benefits for teachers within seconds)
- Trust signals: professional language, clear scope for rights holders, BarreNotes heritage
- Mobile‑first, responsive across 320/768/1280px
- Fast loading on slow networks (sub‑2 second target)
- Accessibility (WCAG AA), fully functional without JavaScript
- No friction: use mailto CTAs, no forms or external dependencies

## Success Criteria
- Teachers initiate contact (join waitlist) from the homepage
- Organizations initiate White Label inquiries via enterprise mailto
- Rights holders understand scope and grant permissions via partnerships mailto
- Site remains static, fast, and accessible with no external requests
- OG/Twitter cards render correctly per page

## Copy and Tone
- Teacher-first language: practical benefits for running class smoothly
- Confident but simple phrasing; minimal jargon
- Transparent legal language for rights holders
- Professional, partnership‑oriented tone for organizations

## Content Sources and Maintenance
- Copy lives in the HTML files per page
- Styles consolidated in a single CSS file with design tokens and shared components
- No JavaScript required; maintain progressive enhancement posture
- Assets live at repo root; preserve width/height in markup to avoid layout shift

## CTAs and Emails
- General (waitlist): hello@cadance.music
- White Label: enterprise@cadance.music
- Publishers: partnerships@cadance.music

## Constraints
- Static site only (GitHub Pages)
- No external dependencies or web fonts
- Must operate without JavaScript; JS file retained only as a placeholder
- WCAG AA accessibility baseline

## Roadmap Notes
- Replace mailto with App Store/Play links when available
- Optional: JSON‑LD (Organization/App) as a static script tag
- Optional: Press/Privacy pages as content grows
- Optional: privacy‑first analytics after policy review
