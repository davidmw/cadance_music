# Product: Cadance for Publishers Marketing Site

## Why This Project Exists
Cadance is a dance class music app that needs legal permission to display album artwork in their App Store and Google Play marketing materials. Without proper permissions, they risk copyright infringement and legal issues. This site serves as the professional interface to establish partnerships with music industry rights holders.

## Problems It Solves
1. **Legal Compliance**: Ensures Cadance has written permission before using any album artwork
2. **Trust Building**: Provides transparency about usage scope and artist benefits
3. **Streamlined Process**: Makes it easy for rights holders to understand and grant permissions
4. **Professional Credibility**: Establishes Cadance as a legitimate business partner
5. **Scalable Partnerships**: Creates a repeatable process for onboarding new artists and labels

## How It Should Work
The site operates as a single-page marketing funnel:

1. **Hero Section**: Immediately communicates the value proposition and permission process
2. **Benefits Section**: Shows what's in it for the rights holders (exposure, controlled usage)
3. **Transparency Section**: Details exactly how artwork will be used and legal protections
4. **Process Section**: Step-by-step workflow for granting permissions
5. **Showcase Section**: Visual examples of how artwork appears in context
6. **Contact Section**: Clear call-to-action to start the permission process

## User Experience Goals
