## Value Proposition Section

## Professional Features Require Music Ownership

Dance teachers need tempo control, offline access, and seamless looping for their classes. These professional features only work with owned music files - streaming simply can't deliver what educators need.

**This means more music purchases for you.**

### Why Teachers Buy Instead of Stream
- **Tempo control requires local files** - can't adjust streaming audio in real-time
- **Classes need offline reliability** - streaming fails when WiFi is down
- **Professional looping demands ownership** - seamless repeats impossible with streams
- **Library building mindset** - teachers collect music like professional tools

## Market Impact Section

## Turning Educators Into Music Buyers Worldwide

### The Cadance Effect
- **10+ years** training dance teachers to own their music
- **Global community** of educators building music libraries
- **Professional necessity** drives purchases, not marketing
- **Platform agnostic** - teachers buy from iTunes, Bandcamp, Amazon, wherever you sell

### Your Music Gains Value
When teachers can control tempo, loop sections, and access tracks offline, your music becomes a professional tool worth paying for - not just entertainment to stream.

## Anti-Streaming by Design Section

## Why Streaming Can't Compete with Ownership

### Technical Limitations of Streaming
- **No real-time tempo adjustment** - streaming audio is locked
- **Internet dependency** - classes can't rely on connectivity
- **No seamless looping** - buffering breaks the flow
- **Ads and interruptions** - unprofessional in class settings

### Ownership Advantages
- **Full audio control** - tempo, pitch, looping as needed
- **Offline reliability** - works anywhere, anytime
- **Professional quality** - no compression or streaming artifacts
- **Clean experience** - no ads, no interruptions, no algorithm interference

**We don't just prefer ownership - we make it essential.**

## Market Opportunity Section

## A Growing Professional Market for Your Music

### Dance Teachers as Music Buyers
- **Professional purchasers** who buy music as business tools
- **Quality over quantity** - select specific tracks for specific needs
- **Repeat customers** - continuously building libraries for different classes
- **Global market** - dance education is worldwide

### Higher Value Perception
When your music enables professional instruction, it's worth more than entertainment streaming. Teachers understand that professional tools cost money.
