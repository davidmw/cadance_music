# Corrected Understanding: Cadance Business Model

## What Cadance Actually Does
- **Sells a professional music player tool** to dance teachers
- **Tool encourages music OWNERSHIP** rather than streaming
- **Teachers buy music from ANY platform** (iTunes, Bandcamp, etc.) as long as it's not DRM-protected
- **Teachers load purchased music** into the Cadance app
- **Cadance doesn't handle music sales** or pay artists directly

## Value Proposition for Musicians (Indirect)
- **Tool creates demand** for purchased music vs streaming
- **Professional features** (tempo control, offline access) require ownership
- **Teachers build libraries** of owned music for classes
- **More music purchases** = more revenue for artists
- **Anti-streaming tool** by design - streaming can't provide the features teachers need

## Key Insight
This is actually MORE powerful for musicians than direct sales because:
1. **Any platform works** - artists aren't locked into Cadance
2. **Creates systematic demand** for music ownership
3. **Professional use case** justifies higher prices
4. **Tool-driven necessity** rather than optional purchase
5. **Builds buying habits** among dance professionals

## Messaging Focus Should Be
- **"Our tool makes streaming useless for dance teachers"**
- **"Teachers need to own music to use our professional features"**
- **"We're driving demand for music purchases across all platforms"**
- **"Your music becomes more valuable when teachers can control tempo"**
