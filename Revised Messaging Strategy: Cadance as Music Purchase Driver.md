# Revised Messaging Strategy: Cadance as Music Purchase Driver

## Core Value Proposition for Musicians
**"Our professional music player makes streaming useless for dance teachers, driving demand for music ownership across all platforms"**

## Strategic Messaging Framework

### Primary Message Pillars

#### 1. Tool-Driven Music Ownership
- **Professional features require ownership**: Tempo control, offline access, looping only work with owned files
- **Streaming can't compete**: No streaming service offers the professional tools teachers need
- **Systematic demand creation**: Every teacher using Cadance becomes a music buyer
- **Platform agnostic**: Teachers buy from iTunes, Bandcamp, Amazon - wherever artists sell

#### 2. Professional Use Case Justification
- **Business necessity**: Teachers need reliable, manipulable music for classes
- **Higher value perception**: Music becomes a professional tool, not entertainment
- **Repeat purchases**: Teachers continuously build libraries for different classes
- **Quality over quantity**: Teachers buy specific tracks they need, not massive catalogs

#### 3. Anti-Streaming by Design
- **Technical necessity**: Professional features impossible with streaming
- **Ownership mindset**: Tool trains teachers to think in terms of building libraries
- **Reliability requirement**: Classes can't depend on internet connectivity
- **No ads or interruptions**: Professional environment demands clean audio

#### 4. Market Expansion for Artists
- **New customer segment**: Dance teachers as professional music buyers
- **Global reach**: Cadance used by dance educators worldwide
- **Established trust**: 10+ years serving dance community
- **Growing market**: More teachers adopting professional tools
