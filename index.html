        <h2>From BarreNotes to Cadance: A Decade of Professional Music Tools</h2>
        <p>Since 2014, BarreNotes has been the professional standard for dance teachers worldwide. Teachers typically build libraries of 200+ albums as they discover how music ownership enables advanced instructional capabilities that streaming services simply cannot provide.</p>
        <p>Cadance is the major upgrade - same professional focus, enhanced with start delays, session timers, and improved library management. Your music library becomes professional equipment.</p>

              <p>When my phone died and I needed to get a new device, the first thing I wanted to add was BarreNotes, but it wasn't there.</p>
              <p>For the past year I've been trying alternatives to fill the gap and got so frustrated with other players that would be harder to navigate making teaching classes less smooth or rehearsals not as time efficient.</p>
              <p>Some would cut off the introductions of class tracks, others had no speed controls, many didn't have a clock displaying the actual time in the app, all little things that are really important to movement professionals trying to use it as an efficient tool.</p>
              <p>I was so thrilled to find Cadance and in my time testing it have found it to have all of the pieces of their previous app that I've come to rely on in the studio as well as some new features that are proving to be really handy.</p>

              <p>Having an app like this is the next best thing to having a pianist in your ballet class. I have used BarreNotes since it's inception and have found it invaluable. And now we have the new, improved version, Cadance. I have been teaching for decades, since the days of cassettes (and even reel to reel!). So much class time was wasted with rewinding, tangled tapes etc. Half the time giving up because it just wasted too much time to find the track you needed. This app makes such a difference. No time wasted trying to find a particular track and of course being able to adjust the speed of the music is something I could only dream of in those days. The app is so simple and intuitive to use; no great technological knowledge required. And I think this is because it is designed by a dancer who knows what dance teachers need. Cadance gives us time to focus on what is important, the dancing and the music. I will be eternally grateful for this app.</p>
