        <h2>10+ Years of Creating Music-Buying Teachers</h2>
        <p>BarreNotes, launched in 2014, trained thousands of dance teachers worldwide that professional music control requires music ownership. <strong>Teachers typically build libraries of 200+ albums</strong> because streaming simply can't provide the features they need for class instruction.</p>
        <p>Cadance is the major upgrade and full replacement for BarreNotes, by the same people - continuing our decade-long mission of making music ownership essential for dance professionals.</p>
